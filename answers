the bullets for each list item are now empty, and the list is slightly indented
the emptied bullets are now moved towards the edge of the page
the bullets for the list items are now turned into black squares
the list items no longer have any bullets, or squares, but just plain lines of text
there's now a red border around the list stretching to the edge of the page on both sides
the bullets are cut-off about half way and everything was moved too far to the left of the page
the text and bullets have moved in towards the center of the page under the second "e" in "exercise"
the bullets have been erased and the text moved all the way to the margin on the left
every list item ,not including bullets, has a dashed black border around it.
there is now more space between each list item, vertically.
the list items have the same border as the previous step, but now with more space between each list item
each list item looks like a white sideways "Z" inside of a black box
similar to the step above, except there is white space between each list item's "black box" and more space off of the margins of the webpage.
the list has become a scroll-able black box, with the only word appearing as "list" in a small white box in the left hand corner, with other random small white boxes in the bottom left corner and the bottom-center
same as step 13, except there are no elements and the entire list is a block element
each list item is in a white rectangle, centered inside of a black square, with item 4 on the same line as item 3
